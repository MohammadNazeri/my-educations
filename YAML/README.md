### YAML vs JSON 
While YAML is similar to JSON in that both are data serialization formats, YAML offers:
  * Supports comments (JSON doesn't).
  * Supports multi-line strings and complex data types.
  * Has a cleaner syntax (no need for quotes around strings or commas between items in lists).
  * However, YAML's syntax can be more prone to errors due to reliance on indentation, whereas JSON is simpler and more rigid, which can sometimes make it more predictable in terms of parsing and handling.
