# Kafka
* Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used to handle real-time data feeds.
* Think of Kafka as a high-performance messaging system where data can be published, stored, and processed in real time â€” often used in large-scale systems like those at Netflix, LinkedIn, or Uber.

* Events are stored in Topics
* Cosumer(microservices) subscribe to Topics. Each respective consumer gets notified when a new event is added to that topic.
