# Kafka
* Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used to handle real-time data feeds.
* Think of Kafka as a high-performance messaging system where data can be published, stored, and processed in real time â€” often used in large-scale systems like those at Netflix, LinkedIn, or Uber.

* Events are stored in Topics
* Cosumer(microservices) subscribe to Topics. Each respective consumer gets notified when a new event is added to that topic.

## Functionality of Kafka
* Enables chain reaction: by ordering a product, it generate squence of action to deliver to user
* Real-time analytics: like Uber whichi send location in real-time

## Kafka performance
* In big project, a Kafka topic is divided into one or more partitions.
* A consumer group is a set of consumers that work together to read data from a topic. This makes it possible to process data in parallel.

## Data Persistence
* After consuming data from topics, there keeps in broker.
* Later, those kept data can be used for analytics.
